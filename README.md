---

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16+ recommended)
- npm (v8+ recommended)
- MongoDB (if using a database)

---

## Installation

### 1. Clone the repository

```sh
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd cleaning-management-system
```

### 2. Install dependencies

#### Client

```sh
cd Client
npm install
```

#### Server

```sh
cd ../Server
npm install
```

---

## Running the Project

### 1. Start the backend server

```sh
cd Server
npm start
```

By default, the server runs on [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).

### 2. Start the frontend React app

```sh
cd ../Client
npm start
```

The React app runs on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and proxies API requests to the backend.

---

## Available Scripts

### Client

- `npm start` â€“ Runs the app in development mode.
- `npm run build` â€“ Builds the app for production.
- `npm test` â€“ Runs tests.
- `npm run eject` â€“ Ejects configuration (advanced).

### Server

- `npm start` â€“ Starts the Express server.

---

## Environment Variables


Create a `.env` file in the `Server/` folder for backend configuration. Example:

```
PORT=5000
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/cleaning-management
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
```

---

## Deployment

### Live Application

The application is deployed and accessible at:
**[https://cleaning-management-system-tau.vercel.app/](https://cleaning-management-system-tau.vercel.app/)**

### Build the frontend

```sh
cd Client
npm run build
```

Deploy the contents of `Client/build` to your web server or hosting platform like Vercel.

### Deploy the backend

Host the `Server` folder on your Node.js server (e.g., Heroku, Vercel, AWS, Railway).

**Note:** The live demo is deployed on Vercel with both frontend and backend components.

## API Endpoints Overview

### Auth
- `POST /api/auth/register` â€“ Register user/admin
- `POST /api/auth/login` â€“ Login user/admin

### Users
- `GET /api/users/me` â€“ Get current user profile
- `PUT /api/users/me` â€“ Update current user profile

### Bookings
- `POST /api/bookings` â€“ Create booking
- `GET /api/bookings/user` â€“ Get bookings for current user
- `PUT /api/bookings/:id` â€“ Update booking
- `DELETE /api/bookings/user/:id` â€“ Delete booking (user)
- `GET /api/bookings` â€“ Get all bookings (admin)
- `PUT /api/bookings/:id/status` â€“ Update booking status (admin)
- `DELETE /api/bookings/:id` â€“ Delete booking (admin)

### Services
- `GET /api/services` â€“ Get active services (public)
- `GET /api/services/admin` â€“ Get all services (admin)
- `POST /api/services` â€“ Add new service (admin)
- `PUT /api/services/:id` â€“ Update service (admin)
- `DELETE /api/services/:id` â€“ Delete service (admin)

## Troubleshooting

- **MongoDB connection issues:** Ensure your `.env` file is in the `Server` folder and contains the correct `MONGODB_URI`.
- **Port conflicts:** Change the `PORT` variable in `.env` if 5000 is in use.
- **Frontend not connecting to backend:** Check `API_BASE_URL` in `Client/src/config.js` and ensure CORS is enabled on the backend.
- **Scripts not running:** Make sure you run scripts from the correct directory and Node.js version is compatible.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the repository

```sh
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd cleaning-management-system
```

### 2. Install dependencies

#### Client

```sh
cd Client
npm install
```

#### Server

```sh
cd ../Server
npm install
```

### 3. Configure environment variables

Create a `.env` file in the `Server/` folder. Example:

```
PORT=5000
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/cleaning-management
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
```


### 4. Create the admin user

Run the script to create the default admin user (make sure your `.env` file uses `MONGODB_URI`):

```sh
cd Server/scripts
node createAdmin.js
```

This will set up the admin account for the system. If you see a MongoDB URI error, ensure your `.env` file is in the `Server` folder and contains `MONGODB_URI`.

### 5. Start the backend server

```sh
cd Server
npm start
```


### 6. Start the frontend React app

```sh
cd ../Client
npm start
```
